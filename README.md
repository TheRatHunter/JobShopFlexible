In this project you will find a few algorithms aiming to find solutions
to the Flexible Job Shop Optimization problem, such as a local 
search algorithm and a genetic algorithm. They are written in Java.

We developped this project using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

To use it, create a Java project within this directory and import all files in src.
You should have a recent JDK set up. You should define a target folder where the .class files
will be generated. (With IntelliJ : File -> Project structure -> Modules -> Sources).
The "TextData" folder should be set as a resource.

Then, set up your IDE in order to run the Main.main class, and the application should 
compile and launch.
